# Django App

This is a Django web application.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the Django app locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/django-app.git
cd django-app
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies. If you don't have `virtualenv` installed, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install virtualenv
```

Create a virtual environment:

```bash
virtualenv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

**For Windows:**

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**For macOS/Linux:**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Requirements

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Django App

Run the development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```
